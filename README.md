myKBsearch
==========

Search aggregator for multiple Knowledge Base sources

## Purpose

I maintain a personal knowledge base (KB) of programming information,
tips, tricks, etc. but it is spread across a variety of services:

-	Bookmarks
-	My own wiki (MediaWiki)
-	Evernote
-	Diigo
-	etc.

Ideally, I'd like to have all these resources used for a single search
query.

Secondarily, I have a friend who has expressed a similar desire to be
able to search multiple local and/or favorite resources at once.

## Roadmap

For the immediate future, the roadmap I plan to follow is

+	**v0.9** *Iteration seed* (PHP)
	+	proof of concept
	+	prototype
	+ iframes
+	**v1.0** *Amazing AJAX* (PHP)
	+	iframe -> div + AJAX
	+ parse search result pages
+	**v2.0** *Java Journey* (Java)
	+ Rewrite back-end in Java
	+ MVC (Swing)
